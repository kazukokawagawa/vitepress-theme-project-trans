## Advocacy and Support for Transgender Women (MtF) in China

MtF.Report is a grassroots platform dedicated to researching and supporting MtF youth in China. Through in-depth studies and authentic stories, we strive to break informational barriers, helping the world understand their struggles and aiding them toward safer and more dignified lives.

### Core Features

- **Research Reports**
  Compiling oral interviews and academic resources, we regularly publish the *Report on the Living Conditions of MtF in China*, highlighting deep-rooted issues such as family violence, medical discrimination, and social exclusion.

- **Donation Channel**
  Transparent and secure donation links ensuring each contribution directly supports:
  1. Basic living essentials (food, shelter, daily necessities)
  2. Safe evacuation and emergency shelters
  3. Medication purchases and psychological counseling
  4. Volunteer stipends and training

## Origin and Background

MtF.Report was officially launched in June 2025 by Four students. During an online discussion, the founders became deeply aware of the severe oppression and discrimination faced by young transgender females (MtF) in China within their families, schools, and healthcare systems. Driven by empathy and compassion, they decided to use their efforts to advocate for and support this marginalized group.

## Initial Motivation and Vision

- **Motivation**: To challenge societal prejudices and misunderstandings about transgender communities by revealing their true living conditions through authentic research reports.
- **Vision**: Regularly publishing oral interviews and data-driven reports to inform the public, policymakers, and potential supporters about the necessary assistance required; building a transparent donation platform to directly allocate funds to improve their lives and ensure their safety.

## Mission and Vision

- **Mission**:

  1. Collect and disseminate authentic data and stories of transgender female youths in China.
  2. Raise and distribute aid funds to provide basic living essentials, medical care, and psychological support.
  3. Establish an advocacy network for transgender rights to promote societal inclusion and policy improvements.
- **Vision**:
  - Gradually eliminate societal prejudice through ongoing research and education, ensuring equal respect and protection for transgender youths across all sectors.

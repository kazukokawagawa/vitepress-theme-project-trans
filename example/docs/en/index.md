## Advocacy and Support for Transgender Women (MtF) in China

MtF.Report is a grassroots platform dedicated to researching and supporting MtF youth in China. We strive to break informational barriers, helping the world understand their struggles and aiding them toward safer and more dignified lives through in-depth studies and authentic stories.

### Core Features

- **Research Reports**
  We regularly publish the *Report on the Living Conditions of MtF in China*, which compiles interviews and academic researches, highlighting deep-rooted issues such as family violence, medical discrimination, and social exclusion.

- **Donation Channel**
  Transparent and secure donation ensures each contribution directly supports:
  1. Living essentials (food, shelter, daily necessities)
  2. Evacuation and emergency shelters from violence
  3. Medication purchases and psychological counseling
  4. Volunteer stipends and training

## Origin and Background

MtF.Report was officially launched in June 2025 by four students. During an online discussion, the founders became deeply aware of the severe oppression and discrimination facing by MtF youth in China within their families, schools, and healthcare systems. Driven by empathy and compassion, they decided to use their efforts to advocate for and support this marginalized group.

## Motivation and Vision

- **Motivation**: To challenge societal prejudices and misunderstandings about transgender communities by revealing their true living conditions through authentic research reports.
- **Vision**: Through regularly publishing interviews and data-driven reports, informing the public, policymakers, and potential supporters about the necessary assistance required; building a transparent donation platform to directly allocate funds to improve their lives and ensure their safety.

## Mission and Vision

- **Mission**:

  1. Collect and disseminate authentic data and stories of transgender female youths in China.
  2. Raise and distribute aid funds to provide basic living essentials, medical care, and psychological support.
  3. Establish an advocacy network for transgender rights to promote societal inclusion and policy improvements.
